A dream of another existence
You wish to die
A dream of another world
You pray for death to release the soul
One must die to find peace inside
You must get eternal
I am a mortal, but am I human?
How beautiful life is now when my time has come
A human destiny, but nothing human inside
What will be left of me when I'm dead?
There was nothing when I lived
What you found was eternal death
No one will ever miss you
