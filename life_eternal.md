A dream of another existence<br>
You wish to die<br>
A dream of another world<br>
You pray for death to release the soul<br>
One must die to find peace inside<br>
You must get eternal<br>
I am a mortal, but am I human?<br>
How beautiful life is now when my time has come<br>
A human destiny, but nothing human inside<br>
What will be left of me when I'm dead?<br>
There was nothing when I lived<br>
What you found was eternal death<br>
No one will ever miss you<br>
