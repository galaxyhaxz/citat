#### Funny

- *I want a webpage to be a page, not an amusement park ride.*

- *"Great Android games." I've heard a lot of talk of those. Never actually seen one.*

- *Electron all by itself is not a bad thing. Problem is that it is akin to a nuclear bomb being used to kill a wasp.*

- *Reverse engineering the game is a behemoth of an undertaking (that's in reference to a professional programmer / reverse engineering specialist). You would be better off creating your own Diablo clone with a popularly supported API!*

#### Truth

- *Browsers were fast and lightweight before Javascript was common. Many, perhaps most, new HTML 5 features do not help provide more content to benefit end users, but are focused on either spying on them (javascript, cookies, etc) or locking down content (everything from DRM, to sites that won't even display anything without javascript enabled).*

- *Modern software development theory is in general about replacing understanding with memorization and sacrificing software quality to save developer time - it's at its best when you're making a small toy app where occasional bugs are acceptable, and its worst when you're making a large cutting-edge project where every bug is serious*

- *You must remember Americans (I am one) are generally poorly educated compared to other developed countries. This is by design, and there is a powerful propaganda arm here that actively undermines efforts to make progress in educating the population.*

- *That's the ultimate problem for Americans who want to leave. To leave, you have to want out of this system. To want out, it must not work for you. To have the money and education to get out, it has to work for you, so it's unlikely those who want to leave can do so.*

- *Low skill jobs are the backbone of our capitalist economy. It could not have been built otherwise.*
